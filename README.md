### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

the topics in class were quite helpful in the completion of this project. But the issue I had was that we we provided introcuctory explanations to relatively complex topics, and I was unable to keep up simply becuase I wasnt ahead. A lot of the things we learned were things that would have clicked well if I had been relaively ahead of class.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have spent more time on the accessibility features and made it better looking in geeral. I would have also paid more attention to the features requested of me on the website.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

One thing I found to be interesting was the fact that we could make a website using information from another webiste via an API, and were able to personalize it for the better. One thing I struggled with this week was being able to keep up with the class, I was never sure if I was behind or whether the class was going too fast. So I decided upon myself to just stay ahead of the class on material so that way I come to class with my questions.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
